## IntelliJ Plugins 

I was asked a lot of questions about which plugins I use for IntelliJ. I am using 2021.3 Ultimate Edition at the time of this recording. The plugins I was asked about the most are: 

- Live Templates: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-live-templates.html
- Http Client: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html
- Github Copilot: https://copilot.github.com/

I created a video on Github Copilot for Java developers https://youtu.be/97C3fQqzj-I
